## Module 15: Deploying ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Applications

## Lab: Deploying ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Applications

#### Scenario

You have completed the development and testing of the photo sharing application. Your managers and senior developers have signed off the project, and have requested you to deploy the application to the Adventure Works Microsoft Azure account.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Prepare an MVC web application for deployment.
- Deploy an MVC web application to Microsoft Azure.

#### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **45 minutes**

In this lab, you will create a web application in Microsoft Azure that runs in Free mode. Free mode is an excellent tool for testing and running small, non-intensive web applications. However, there is a limit of data transfer per day on the Free mode tool. After completing Exercise 2, you are encouraged to further test the deployed web application. However, if you do a lot of extra testing, you may encounter the limit and the application may become unavailable.

### Exercise 1: Deploying a Web Application to Microsoft Azure

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will:

- Reconfigure the Photo Sharing application for release deployment.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Prepare the Photo Sharing application project for deployment.

2. Create a new web app in Microsoft Azure.

3. Deploy the Photo Sharing application.

#### Task 1: Prepare the Photo Sharing application project for deployment.
