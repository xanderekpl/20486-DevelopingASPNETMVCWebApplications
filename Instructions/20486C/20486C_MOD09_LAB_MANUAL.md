# Module 9: Building Responsive Pages in ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Applications

# Lab: Building Responsive Pages in ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Applications

#### Scenario

Your manager has asked you to include comments for photos in the Photo Sharing application. Your manager has also highlighted that the performance of some pages in the application is too slow for a production site.

You want to ensure that comments for photos take minimal loading time, for which you decide to use partial page updates. You also want to return pages in quick time, while updated information is displayed, for which you decide to configure caching in your application.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Write controller actions that can be called asynchronously and return partial views.
- Use common AJAX helpers to call asynchronous controller actions, and insert the results into Razor views.
- Configure ASP.NET caches to serve pages in quick time.

#### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **60 minutes**

### Exercise 1: Using Partial Page Updates

#### Scenario

You have been asked to include a comment functionality on the photo display view of the Photo Sharing application. You want to ensure high performance by using AJAX partial page updates.

In this exercise, you will

- Import a partially complete controller to add comments, and a view to delete comments.
- Add code to the controller for partial page update.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Import the Comment controller and Delete view.

2. Add the _CommentsForPhoto action and view.

3. Add the _Create Action and the _CreateAComment views.

4. Add the _CommentsForPhoto POST action.

5. Complete the _CommentsForPhoto view.

#### Task 1: Import the Comment controller and Delete view.

1. Open the **PhotoSharingApplication.sln** file from the following location:

	- File location: **Allfiles(D):\Mod09\Labfiles\Starter\PhotoSharingApplication**

2. Create a new folder in the **Views** folder by using the following information:

	- Name of the new folder: **Comment**

3. Add an existing item to the new **Comment** folder by using the following information:

	- File location of the existing item: **Allfiles(D):\Mod09\Labfiles\Comment Components\Delete.cshtml**

4. Add an existing item to the **Controller** folder by using the following information:

	- File location of the existing item: **Allfiles(D):\Mod09\Labfiles\Comment Components\CommentController.cs**

#### Task 2: Add the _CommentsForPhoto action and view.

	- Annotation: **ChildActionOnly**
	- Scope: **public**
	- Return type: **PartialViewResult**
	- Name: **_CommentsForPhoto**
	- Parameter: an integer named **PhotoId**

2. In the **_CommentsForPhoto** action, select all the comments in the database that have a **PhotoID** value equal to the **PhotoId** parameter, by using a LINQ query.
3. Save the **PhotoId** parameter value in the **ViewBag** collection to use it later in the view.
4. Return a partial view as the result of the **_CommentsForPhoto** action by using the following information:

	- View name: **_CommentsForPhoto**
	- Model: **comments.ToList()**

5. Add a new partial view to display a list of comments by using the following information:

	- Parent folder: **Views/Shared**
	- View name: **_CommentsForPhoto**
	- View type: **Strong**.
	- Model class: **Comment**
	- Create partial view: **Yes**.

6. Bind the **_CommentsForPhoto.cshtml** view to an enumerable collection of comments.
7. Create an **H3** element by using the following information:

	- Heading: **Comments**

8. After the heading, create a **DIV** element with the ID **comments-tool**. Within this **DIV** element, create a second **DIV** element with the ID **all-comments**.
9. For each item in the model, render a **DIV** element with the **photo-comment** class.
10. Within the **&lt;div class=&quot;photo-comment&quot;&gt;** element, add a **DIV** element with the **photo-comment-from** class. Within this **DIV** element, render the **UserName** value of the model item by using the **Html.DisplayFor()** helper.

	- Subject: **Test Comment**
	- Body content: **This comment is to test AJAX-based partial page updates.**

7. Stop debugging.

   >**Results** : At the end of this exercise, you will have ensured that new comments can be added and displayed on the pages of the application without a complete page reload. You will create a Photo Sharing application with a comments tool, implemented by using partial page updates.

### Exercise 2: Optional—Configuring the ASP.NET Caches

#### Scenario

You have been asked to configure the ASP.NET caches in the Photo Sharing application to ensure optimal performance. Senior developers are particularly concerned that the All Photos gallery might render slowly because it will fetch and display many photos from the database at a time.

In this exercise, you will:

- Configure the output cache to store the photo index view.
- Use the developer tools in Internet Explorer to examine the speed at which image files and pages render with and without caching.
- Configure the output cache to store the results of the GetImage action so that image files can be returned from the cache.

Complete this exercise if time permits.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Test the All Photos page with no caching.

2. Configure caching for the Index action.

3. Retest the All Photos page with Index caching.

4. Configure caching for the GetImage action.

5. Retest the All Photo page with GetImage caching.

#### Task 1: Test the All Photos page with no caching.

1. Start the application in debugging mode and configure the browser to always refresh the **page** from the server by using the Internet Explorer developer tools.

2. Capture traffic between the browser and the server when the **All Photos** page is loaded, by using the Network tools.
3. Record the time taken by the server to render the **/Photo** page and return the page to the browser. This value is the **Request** duration, which you can find on the **Timings** tab.
4. Clear the first network capture, and capture a second request to the **All Photos** page.
5. Record the second instance of time taken by the server to render the **/Photo** page and return the page to the browser. Observe if the duration is more or less than the first instance.
6. Stop debugging.

#### Task 2: Configure caching for the Index action.

1. Open the **PhotoController.cs** code file, and add a **using** statement for the following namespace: **System.Web.UI**
2. Configure the **Index** action to use the output cache by using the following information:

	- Duration: **10 minutes**
	- Location: **Server**
	- Vary by parameters: **None**

3. Save all your changes.

#### Task 3: Retest the All Photos page with Index caching.

1. Start the application in debugging mode, and configure the browser to always refresh the page from the server, by using the Internet Explorer developer tools.

2. Capture the traffic between the browser and the server when the **All Photos** page is loaded, by using the Network tools.
3. Record the time taken by the server to render the **/Photo** page and return the page to the browser. This value is the **Request** duration, which you can find on the **Timings** tab.
4. Clear the first network capture, and capture a second request to the **All Photos** page.
5. Record the second instance of the time taken by the server to render the **/Photo** page and return the page to the browser. Observe if the duration is more or less than the first instance.
6. Record the time taken by the server to render the **/Photo/GetImage/1** request.
7. Stop debugging.

#### Task 4: Configure caching for the GetImage action.

1. In the **PhotoController**, configure the **GetImage** action to use the output cache, by using the following information:

	- Duration: **10 minutes**.
	- Location: **Server**
	- Vary by parameters: **id**

2. Save all your changes.

#### Task 5: Retest the All Photo page with GetImage caching.

1. Start the application in debugging mode and configure the browser to always refresh the page from the server, by using the Internet Explorer developer tools.

2. Capture the traffic between the browser and the server when the **All Photos** page is loaded, by using the Network tools.
3. Record the time taken by the server to render the **/Photo/GetImage/1** request.
4. Clear the first network capture, and capture a second request to the **All Photos** page.
5. Record the second instance of the time taken by the server to render the **/Photo/GetImage/1** request and return the page to the browser.
6. Close the developer tools, stop debugging, and close Visual Studio.

   >**Results** : At the end of this exercise, you will create a Photo Sharing application with the Output Cache configured for caching photos.
