### Exercise 1: Creating Favorites Controller Actions

#### Task 1: Create the Favorites Slideshow action.

1. On the taskbar, click the **File Explorer** icon.
2. In the **Libraries** window, go to **Allfiles(D):\Mod12\Labfiles\Starter\PhotoSharingApplication**, and then double-click **PhotoSharingApplication.sln**.
3. On the **BUILD** menu of the **PhotoSharingApplication - Microsoft Visual Studio** window, click Build Solution.
4. In the **Solution Explorer** pane of the **PhotoSharingApplication - Microsoft Visual Studio** window, expand **PhotoSharingApplication**, expand **Controllers**, and then click **PhotoController.cs**.
5. In the **PhotoController.cs** code window, locate the following code.

  ```cs
       public ActionResult SlideShow()
       {
          return View("SlideShow", context.Photos.ToList());
       }
```
6. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the located code, press Enter twice, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
       public ActionResult FavoritesSlideShow()
       {
       }
```
7. Place the cursor within the **FavoritesSlideShow** action code block you just created, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        List<Photo> favPhotos = new List<Photo>();
```
8. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the **favPhotos** list code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        List<int> favoriteIds = Session["Favorites"] as List<int>;
```
9. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the **favoriteIds** list code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        if (favoriteIds == null)
        {
           favoriteIds = new List<int>();
        }
```
10. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the **if** statement code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        Photo currentPhoto;
```
11. Place the mouse cursor at the of the **currentPhoto** object code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        foreach (int currentId in favoriteIds)
        {
        }
```
12. Place the mouse cursor within the **foreach** code block you just created, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        currentPhoto = context.FindPhotoById(currentId);
```
13. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the code you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        if (currentPhoto != null)
        {
           favPhotos.Add(currentPhoto);
        }
```
14. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the **foreach** code block you created earlier, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        return View("SlideShow", favPhotos);
```
   >**Note:** You do not need to create a new view for the **FavoritesSlideShow** action. Instead, you can re-use the **SlideShow.cshtml** view by passing a different list of **Photo** objects.

15. On the **FILE** menu of the **PhotoSharingApplication – Microsoft Visual Studio** window, click **Save All**.

#### Task 2: Create the Add Favorite action.

1. Place the mouse cursor immediately after the **FavoritesSlideShow** action code block, but inside the **PhotoController** class code block, and then type the following code.

       public ContentResult AddFavorite(int PhotoId)
       {
       }
```
2. Place the cursor within the **AddFavorite** action code block you just created, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
       List<int> favoriteIds = Session["Favorites"] as List<int>;
```
3. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the **favoriteIds** list code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
       if (favoriteIds == null)
       {
          favoriteIds = new List<int>();
       }
```

       return Content("The picture has been added to your favorites", "text/plain", System.Text.Encoding.Default);
```
7. On the **FILE** menu of the **PhotoSharingApplication – Microsoft Visual Studio** window, click **Save All**.

>**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully created controller actions that store values in the session state of the web application, and retrieved values from the same session state.

### Exercise 2: Implementing Favorites in Views
