# Module 5: Developing ASP.NET MVC 5 Views

# Lab: Developing ASP.NET MVC 5 Views

#### Scenario

You have been asked to add the following views to the photo sharing application:

- _A Display view for the Photo model objects_. This view will display a single photo in a large size, with the title, description, owner, and created date properties.
- _A Create view for the Photo model objects_. This view will enable users to upload a new photo to the gallery and set the title and description properties.
- _A Photo Gallery partial view_. This view will display many photos in thumbnail sizes, with the title, owner, and created date properties. This view will be used on the **All Photos** webpage to display all the photos in the application. In addition, this view will also be used on the home page to display the three most recent photos.

After adding these three views to the photo sharing application, you will also test the working of the web application.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Add Razor views to an MVC application and set properties such as scaffold and model binding.
- Write both HTML markup and C# code in a view by using Razor syntax.
- Create a partial view and use it to display re-usable markup.
