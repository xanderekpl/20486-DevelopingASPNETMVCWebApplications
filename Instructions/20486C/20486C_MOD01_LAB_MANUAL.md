## Module 1: Exploring ASP.NET MVC 5

## Lab: Exploring ASP.NET MVC 5

#### Scenario

You are working as a junior developer at Adventure Works. You have been asked by a senior developer to investigate the possibility of creating a web-based photo sharing application for your organization's customers, similar to one that the senior developer has seen on the Internet. Such an application will promote a community of cyclists who use Adventure Works equipment, and the community members will be able to share their experiences. This initiative is intended to increase the popularity of Adventure Works Cycles, and thereby to increase sales. You have been asked to begin the planning of the application by examining an existing photo sharing application and evaluating its functionality. You have also been asked to examine programming models available to ASP.NET developers. To do this, you need to create basic web applications written with three different models: Web Pages, Web Forms, and MVC. Your manager has asked you to report on the following specific questions for each programming model:

- How does the developer set a connection string and data provider?
- How does the developer impose a consistent layout, with Adventure Works branding and menus, on all pages in the web application?
- How does the developer set a cascading style sheet with a consistent set of color, fonts, borders, and other styles?
- How does the developer add a new page to the application and apply the layout and styles to it?

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Describe and compare the three programming models available in ASP.NET.
- Describe the structure of each web application developed in the three programming models—Web Pages, Web Forms, and MVC.
- Select an appropriate programming model for a given set of web application requirements.

#### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **45 minutes**
