## Module 3: Developing ASP.NET MVC 4 Models

## Lab: Developing ASP.NET MVC 4 Models

#### Scenario

You are planning to create and code an MVC model that implements your plan for photos and comments in the Adventure Works photo sharing application. The model must store data in a Microsoft Azure SQL database and include properties that describe photos, comments, and their content. The model must enable the application to store uploaded photos, edit their properties, and delete them in response to user requests.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a new ASP.NET MVC 4 project in Visual Studio 2012.
- Add a new model to the ASP.NET MVC 4 web application and add properties to the model.
- Use display and edit data annotations in the MVC model to assign property attributes to views and controllers.
- Use Visual Studio to create a new Microsoft Azure SQL database and connect to the database.
- Add Entity Framework code to the model classes in the MVC model.
- Use display and edit data annotations in the MVC model to assign property attributes to views and controllers.

### Exercise 4: Creating a New Microsoft Azure SQL Database

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will:

2. Add an Entity Framework Initializer.

3. Create a Microsoft Azure SQL database and obtain a connection string.

#### Task 1: Add an Entity Framework Context to the model.

1. Use the NuGet Package Manager to add Entity Framework 5.0 to the application.
2. Add a new class named **PhotoSharingContext** to the **Models** folder and ensure that the new class inherits the **System.Data.Entity.DbContext** class.
3. Add public **DbSet** properties to Photosand Comments to enable Entity Framework to create database tables called Photos and Comments.

#### Task 2: Add an Entity Framework Initializer.

1. Add a new class named **PhotoSharingInitializer** to the **Models** folder and ensure that the new class inherits the **DropCreateDatabaseAlways&lt;PhotoSharingContext&gt;** class.
2. Open the getFileBytes.txt file from the following location and add all the text of the file as a new method to the PhotoSharingInitializer class:

   - File path: **Allfiles (D):\Labfiles\Mod03\CodeSnippets**

3. Override the **Seed** method in the **PhotoSharingInitializer** class.
4. Create a new list of **Photo** objects in the **Seed** method. The list should contain one photo object with the following properties:

   - Title: **Test Photo**
   - Description: _&lt;A description of your choice&gt;_
   - UserName: **NaokiSato**
   - PhotoFile: **getFileBytes(&quot;\\Images\\flower.jpg&quot;)**

   - CreatedDate: &lt;_Today&#39;s date&gt;_

5. Add each **photo** object in the **photos** list to the Entity Framework context, and then save the changes to the context.
6. Create a new list of Comment objects in the **Seed** method. The list should contain one **Comment** object with the following properties:

   - PhotoID: **1**
   - UserName: **NaokiSato**
   - Subject: **Test Comment**
   - Body: **This comment should appear in photo 1**

7. Add the comment list to the Entity Framework context and save the comment to the database.
8. Open **Global.asax** and add a line of code to the **Application_Start** method that calls **Database.SetInitializer**, passing a new **PhotoSharingInitializer** object. Also add the following namespaces:

   - **using System.Data.Entity;**
   - **using PhotoSharingApplication.Models;**

#### Task 3: Create a Microsoft Azure SQL database and obtain a connection string.

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Azure portal by using the portal address: **https://manage.windowsazure.com**

   - Rule name: **First Address Range**
   - Start IP Address: _&lt;first address in range&gt;_
   - End IP Address: _&lt;last address in range&gt;_

4. Obtain the connection string for the **PhotoSharingDB** database and add it to the **Web.config** file.
5. Build the Photo Sharing application.

 >**Results** : After completing this exercise, you should have successfully created an MVC application that uses Microsoft Azure SQL Database as its data store.

### Exercise 5: Testing the Model and Database
