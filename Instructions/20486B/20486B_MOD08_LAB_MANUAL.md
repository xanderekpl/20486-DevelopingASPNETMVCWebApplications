## Module 8: Applying Styles to ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Applications

## Lab: Applying Styles to MVC 4 Web Applications

#### Scenario

You have created a good amount of the photo-handling functionality for the Photo Sharing web application. However, stakeholders are concerned about the basic black-and-white appearance of the application. In addition, they want the titles and menus to appear on every page.

To resolve these issues, your manager asked you to implement the following user interface features:

- A layout for all webpages. The layout should include common elements, such as the main menu and breadcrumb controls, which should appear on every page of the application.
- A style sheet and images for all webpages.The web design team has provided an HTML mockup application to show how the final product should look. This mockup includes a style sheet and image files. You need to import these files and apply them to every page of the application.
- A mobile-specific view. The web application should be accessible from mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets. In particular, you need to ensure that devices with narrow screens can access photos easily.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Apply a consistent look and feel to the web application.
- Use layouts to ensure that common interface features, such as the headers, are consistent across the entire web application.
- Ensure that the web application renders smoothly on screens of different sizes and aspect ratios.

#### Lab Setup
